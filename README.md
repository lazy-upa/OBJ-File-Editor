# OBJ-File-Editor
This was done as a group project with my friends for a project submission for computer graphics.

This project implements reading OBJ files from the user for visualization in different views, like orthographic and perspective views. This project also implements the wireframe viewing mode, vertex selection, and vertex transformation so that the shape of the object can be altered.
